# CGPA-Calculator
The CGPA calculator project in C++ for engineering students incorporates class inheritance, if-else statements, and file handling. The program allows users to input marks, calculate CGPA, and store results in a file for future reference. It retrieves student data from the file, making the application more efficient and persistent.
